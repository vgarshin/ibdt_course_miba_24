# Introduction to Big Data Modern Technologies course
## Goals and objectives

Today data analysts have to use different big data analysis tools almost on a daily basis. Data analysts should have a base knowledge of the big data modern technologies and basic cases which require one or another approach to collect, store and process a large amount pf business data.

During the course students will learn:
- Basic concepts of modern data storage technologies,
- Difference between SQL vs NoSQL data bases and when to use one or another approach,
- Data transportation techniques,
- Hadoop ecosystem along with scheduling and management tools.

## Prerequisites 

Development Essentials, Machine Learning and Big Data Analysis (not necessary, but would be a plus)

## Learning outcomes

After the course the students will have knowledge and skills of:
- Big Data processing and analyzing tools;
- Understanding use of big data structures and computational algorithms;
- Working with state-of-the-art data bases technologies stacks.

## Structure and content

1. Evolution of data and tools for their storage and processing:
    1. From data to big data, what is big data
    2. Development of tools for working with data â€“ databases, the basics of relational databases
    3. Limitations of the "classical" approach and relational databases
    4. Solving scaling issues, new tools for big data

2. NoSQL databases:
    1. Way to solve scalability and availability problems
    2. BASE vs ACID
    3. NoSQL databases (document-oriented, key-value, graph, column-based)
    4. Advantages and disadvantages of NoSQL
    5. Popular NoSQL frameworks and cases of their application

3. Hadoop ecosystem:
    1. Apache Hadoop, architecture principles, HDFS file system
    2. MapReduce concept, implementation in Hadoop
    3. From Hadoop 1 to Hadoop 2: move to YARN
    4. Advantages and disadvantages of MapReduce, from MapReduce to alternative engines (Spark)

4. Modern Hadoop:
    1. Spark engine as an alternative to MapReduce, weaknesses of MapReduce and power of Spark
    2. SQL in Hadoop: Hive, Impala
    3. NoSQL in Hadoop: HBase
    4. Next steps for Big Data framework (S3)

5. Data lake concept and tools:
    1. Data loading, batch vs streaming
    2. File storage, Data formats: parquet, ORG, thrift, avro, json, csv
    3. Processing, scheduling and management tools
    4. Analytics and delivery, BI
    5. Security, authentication and authorization, audit

6. Overview of the modern market and ways of its development:
    1. Cloud platforms and modern solutions to work with data, Bare-metal vs Clouds for Big Data solutions
    2. The largest providers on the Russian and international market
    3. Problems and the future development
